Copy the contents below into a file named main.js and read through the exercises and provide the answers or code required.

Create a repo on github called JS-Intro and push up the correct answers.

The repo should contain the following
README.md (with a description)
.gitignore (add .DS_Store to it)
main.js (completed of course)
